JavaScript-DebugConsole version 0.01
====================================

This is version 0.01 of JavaScript::DebugConsole 

This package generates JavaScript popups with custom text and typical web
development useful informations.
I packaged some my old and simple functions inside a Perl module (I was tired to
do cut&paste each time :-) ) to generate the necessary JavaScript code in order
to open a popup window with custom text and typical web development useful infos
(like form params, environment variables, HTTP headers and so on).

See perldoc JavaScript::DebugConsole for module documentation and use
